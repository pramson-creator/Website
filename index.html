          <h3>Step 1: Pick a Path</h3>
          <p>
            Visit each path page using the navigation at the top. Read the short descriptions and decide which one feels most interesting:
            helping people with tech (IT), defending systems (cybersecurity), or building software (computer science).

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Step 2: Choose 1–2 Resources</h3>
          <p>
            Don’t try to do everything at once. Pick one main resource and one backup. Commit to studying a small amount every day
            (even 20–30 minutes can make progress over time).
